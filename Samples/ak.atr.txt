SCENE: "APPOINTMENT KEPT" - AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER




(Christmas.  Terry lies on the sofa with a book and a blanket over her legs.  The doorbell rings and the Housekeeper opens the door.  Nickie is in the doorway, overcoat draped over his arm, hat in hand).


NICKIE:        (to Housekeeper).  Uh, does Miss McKay -


(He sees Terry on the sofa.  The Housekeeper steps aside, holding the door open).


TERRY:        Nickie -


NICKIE:        (walking in slowly).  Hello, Terry.  (puts overcoat and hat on a chair).


TERRY:        Oh, it's - g-good to see you.


NICKIE:        Oh, it's good to see you, too.  You feeling all right?


TERRY:        Y-yes, yes.  I - I'm fine.  I'm just resting.


NICKIE:        Good, good.  Good.


TERRY:        Well, it's - been a long time.


NICKIE:        Yes, hasn't it?  (walks to end of sofa).


TERRY:        Well it, it is good to see you.


NICKIE:        You said that.  May I, uh -


TERRY:        Oh, yes, please do.  Sit down.


NICKIE:        (decides where to sit).  I'll only be a minute.  I'm sure you don't
                mind.  (sits across from her).


TERRY:        No, no, of - course not.


NICKIE:        (noting apartment).  Oh, uh, is this the breathtaking view?


TERRY:        Well, the - the altitude bothered me.


NICKIE:        Yeah, yeah.  (smiles slightly, thinks).  Well I'll, uh - (clears throat).
                I'll bet you're wondering how I got here


TERRY:        Well, yes.  Yes, yes, I am.


NICKIE:        Well, I was uh, I was looking through the telephone book for a man
                named McBride, and I, uh, I came across the name T. McKay.
                And I said to myself, “Oh, now, could that possibly be Terry 
McKay, my old friend?”


“APPOINTMENT KEPT” - PAGE TWO


TERRY:        And it was.


NICKIE:        Yes, yes.  And then I said to myself, “Well now uh, I haven't been
                very nice to Miss McKay.  After all, I had an appointment with
                her one day, and uh, I didn't keep it.”


TERRY:        You didn't keep -


NICKIE:        No.  ( smiles, rises).  Well, so I, I said to myself - I talk to myself quite 
a lot these days - I said, uh, “Well, that's not a very nice way to treat 
an old friend like Miss McKay.  I must apologize to         Miss McKay.”  
Because don't you agree when someone doesn't keep an appointment 
they should apologize?  Hm?


TERRY:        Yes.  Oh, yes, I think you're absolutely right.  I-I - well, I-I think the
                least people could do is to say they're - sorry, or something.


NICKIE:        So here I am.


TERRY:        That's very sweet.


NICKIE:        I thought so.


TERRY:        I've often wondered about you.


NICKIE:        (sardonic laugh). Huh-uh-uh.


TERRY:        And how you were.


NICKIE:        Did you really?


TERRY:        Yes, really.


NICKIE:        Oh, well I - I've often thought about you, too.  (clasping hands,
                coming back toward sofa).  Then, uh - then you weren't angry
                because I wasn't there?  I mean, you must have been at first.


TERRY:        Oh, well - yes.  Yes, yes I was.  At, at first I was furious.  I said,
                “He can't do this to me.  Who does he think he is?”


NICKIE:        (with hands on back of the sofa).  Hm.  How long did you wait?  I
                mean, did you wait long?


TERRY:        Uh, well, let's - yeah, well yes.  Yes, I, I waited until about -


NICKIE:        Midnight.


TERRY:        Oh.


NICKIE:        And then what did you do?


“APPOINTMENT KEPT” - PAGE THREE


TERRY:        Well, then I got really mad.  Mmm.  Well, you can imagine, standing
                up there on the -


NICKIE:        Yes, in the thunderstorm.


TERRY:        In a thunderstorm.


NICKIE:        Then what did you say to yourself?


TERRY:        Well then, then I said, “Aw, go on home and get tight.”


NICKIE:        But you didn't do that.


TERRY:        Didn't I?


NICKIE:        No.  (rounding sofa).   Well, uh - maybe just a little one.  Every hour
                for about a month.


TERRY:        Can you blame me?


NICKIE:        Oh, I should say not.  The least I could have done was to have sent you
                a note.


TERRY:        Well, perhaps by the time you thought of it, you didn't know where to
                reach me.


NICKIE:        But you swore that if you ever saw me again, you'd ask.


TERRY:        N-no.  N-no.  I remembered we said that if we could make it, we'd be
                there.  And if one of us didn't show up, it would be for a darn
                good reason.


NICKIE:        Did we say that?


TERRY:        Yes, that, that is exactly what we said.


NICKIE:        Well, like what, for instance?


TERRY:        (overlapping).  So - there will be no more questions asked - I hope?


NICKIE:        Hmm.


TERRY:        Would you like a cigarette?


NICKIE:        Thank you.  (leans over to cigarette box, takes cigarette).


TERRY:        Thank you, Nickie.




“APPOINTMENT KEPT” - PAGE FOUR


NICKIE:        Isn't that wonderful?  I walked all the way here just to - and now I'm 
not even supposed to ask you why you weren't there.  Isn't that 
strange?  We used to read each other's thoughts.  It's not the same, 
is it?


TERRY:        Not quite.


NICKIE:        Hmm.  (puts hands on sofa back).  It doesn't seem -


TERRY:        I know.


NICKIE:        I don't know what happens to me.  Whenever I - ( beat).  No
                wedding ring, I see.


TERRY:        (beat, looking at hand).  No.


NICKIE:        Well, I thought at the -


TERRY:        The - last night, the show?  No, no.  He was just - no.


NICKIE:        I didn't mean to offend you.  Hmph.  (he walks to a cabinet with
                an ashtray and puts the unlit cigarette in it).


TERRY:        How's everything with you, Nickie?


NICKIE:        Oh, you can ask questions.


TERRY:        Mm-hm.


NICKIE:        (smiles).  Well, I thought everything was fine until I saw you last 
night.  Then I knew there must be something between us, even if
                it's only an ocean - so I bought myself a ticket.


TERRY:        Oh, you're - sailing?


NICKIE:        Tonight.  (moving back to sofa).  And you're happy, aren't you?


TERRY:        (moving hand over sofa back).  Yes, yes.  And you?


NICKIE:        I don't know.  I'm worried about the future.  I don't know what people
                will think.  They'll say, “There he goes, the mad painter.  There's
                something the matter with him, he doesn't like women.”


TERRY:        (looking down).  Why would people say that?


NICKIE:        Why?  Well, because he sails the seven seas and to every woman he
                meets he says, “Where will you be in six months?”  Hm.


TERRY:        And they're there?
 
“APPOINTMENT KEPT” - PAGE FIVE


NICKIE:        Everywhere.  Tops of pyramids, the domes of cathedrals, the Eiffel
                Tower.  He still tries to keep them up high.


(Nickie holds up his hand as he did at their first dinner, turns his back to her).


TERRY:        He keeps them waiting.


NICKIE:        Sure.  Waiting, waiting, waiting.


TERRY:        And where is he all this time?


(Nickie turns around and drops his hands).


NICKIE:        Waiting.


TERRY:        (placing arm over sofa back).  But you can't go on like that.  It isn't
                right for you.  Oh, I wish I could say you were wrong.


NICKIE:        I was once.


(Beat, as Terry reacts).


                How'd you like to change the subject?  (nearing sofa).


TERRY:        Yes, yes.  I'd love to.  M-Merry Christmas.


NICKIE:        Oh, I almost forgot.


(Nickie walks to the chair where his coat is draped and pulls out a gift with white wrapping paper and a gold ribbon).


                Now, six months later, who'd have thought we'd be spending Christmas
                together in front of a nice, warm fire?  I brought you a present.


TERRY:        (taking the box).  Oh, thank you.  I - I'm sorry, I - don't have one for
                you, I - didn't think I'd be seeing you.


NICKIE:        That's all right, I didn't expect one.  That isn't really a 
Christmas present.


(Terry opens the present.  It's the shawl of Nickie's grandmother.  Their eyes meet).


TERRY:        (holding it, looking at it).  Oh, that's why my letters came back.
                (she wraps the shawl around her shoulders).


NICKIE:        I would have sent it to you, but I didn't know your address until today.
                She wanted you to have it, remember?


(Terry nods, eyed downcast).


“APPOINTMENT KEPT” - PAGE SIX


NICKIE:        (continued).  So, uh, well, that's the, uh, reason I -


(Nickie goes to the chair, picks up his coat and hat, drapes them over his arm, returns).


                Good-bye, Terry.  (he offers his hand).


TERRY:        (taking Nickie's hand).  Goodbye, Nickie.


(Nickie leans over and kisses her hand.  Her eyes are full of love.  Her hand stays in the air a moment.  His throat clears as it always does.  He walks to the door.  He stops and turns).


NICKIE:        You know, I painted you like that with the shawl.  I wish you could
                have seen it.  Courbet said it was one of my best.  I didn't think I
                could ever part with it.  But, well, there was no reason to keep it
                any longer, and uh, I couldn't take money for it, because, well, you
                know.  So, uh, Courbet told me a young woman came into the
                gallery, and uh, she liked it.  She saw in it what I hoped you'd see,
                so I told Courbet to give it to her - because, uh, he said she didn't
                have any money, and not only that, she was, uh, she was -


(Nickie is thinking, starting toward Terry, trying to speak casually).


                Anyway, I told him to give it to her.  Courbet said she wanted it so
                badly (puts coat and hat on sofa back) and uh, so I told him to give
                it to her (moving toward bedroom), you know, it's the Christmas
                season and all that.  (at door).  And uh, you know me, holly in
                my heart.


(He opens the bedroom door and enters.  He stops, staring at the painting.  He returns to the living room and walks to her slowly, realizing she's paralyzed).


TERRY:        (eyes welling).  Darling, don't look at me like that.


NICKIE:        (lowering to her, staring into her eyes).  Why didn't you tell me?  If
                it had to happen to one of us, why did it have to be you?


(Nickie embraces her.  Her lips go to his neck).


TERRY:        Oh.  It was nobody's fault but my own.  (her lips at his earlobe and cheek).
                I - I was looking up.  It was the nearest thing to heaven.  You were 
                there.  (pulling back).  Oh, darling, don't - don't worry, darling. (wiping
                her lipstick off him with her hand).  If you can paint, I can walk.  
Anything can happen, don't you think?


NICKIE:        Yes, darling, yes.  (he dabs her eyes with handkerchief).  Yes, yes, yes.


(Their lips brush, hands on cheeks, as they embrace).
